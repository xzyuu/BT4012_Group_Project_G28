In the digital age, one of the most common crimes that society aims to resolve is observed in credit card transaction frauds. Making microtransactions across thousands of accounts, the human eye hardly ever detects such transactions until it is too late. The impact of such scams can amount up to 20 million dollars, just from bank frauds alone in a year (CNA, 2022). Users of credit cards are facing risks of identity theft and unauthorized transactions while banks lose huge amounts of capital for their businesses. To provide various parties with a solution, the team has decided to improve detection of credit card fraud using data driven algorithms. In this project, we implement fraud detection pipeline for credit card transactions through analysis and selection of appropriate machine learning tools. Using business understanding of financial frauds, we evaluate models based on their statistical accuracy and interpretability.
